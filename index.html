    <p>My research sits at the intersection of two research programmes: imprecise probability and epistemic utility theory. 
    Imprecise probability theory (IP) generalizes traditional Bayesianism. IP is really a family of 
    frameworks for modeling uncertainty and choice: lower probabilities, lower previsions, sets of desirable gambles, sets of 
    desirable gamble sets, choice functions, probability filters, and more. These frameworks all yield the precise probabilities 
    of traditional Bayesianism as a special limiting case, but make fewer structural assumptions about rational belief and choice.</p>
  
    <p>Epistemic utility theory, on the other hand, aims to provide rigorous, decision-theoretic justifications for norms governing 
    rational belief. It does this in two stages. Firstly, it pins down what is that makes one's beliefs epistemically valuable at a 
    world, and proposes epistemic utility functions that measure this sort of value. Secondly, it uses the machinery of decision 
    theory to show that certain epistemic norms are a better means to the end of epistemic value than others.</p>
  
    <p>Historically, epistemic utility theory focused only on precise probability models. I am currently leading a research project funded by the European Research Council which extends epistemic utility theory to norms governing imprecise 
    probability models.</p>
  
    <p>Before moving to Bristol, I was a lecturer at the <a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/">University of Kent</a> and an Assistant 
    Professor at <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/">Kansas State University</a>. I was also a postdoc on Richard Pettigrewâ€™s 
    <a href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/projects/epistemic-utility-theory-foundations-and-applications">ERC project</a>. 
    I received my PhD from the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> where I worked with 
    <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/people/faculty/jjoyce.html">Jim Joyce</a>.</p>
