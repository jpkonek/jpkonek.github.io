      <description>Summary This dissertation presents a study of choice functions as a tool to model uncertainty. Choice functions constitute a very general uncertainty model that is capable of representing a rich variety of types of beliefs. In particular, it includes as a special case sets of desirable gambles, the most general binary—or pairwise—choice model in imprecise probabilities. So the field of this dissertation is `imprecise probabilities&amp;rsquo;, which is an umbrella term for mathematical models that are meant to be used in situations of imprecise or incomplete information, where it may not be possible (or advisable) to use (precise) probabilities.</description>
